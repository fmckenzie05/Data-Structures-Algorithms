# CS469_Algorithms

Repository of Algorithms based on the weekly assignments

## ðŸ“”[Week 1][W1]: Python Fundamentals

This task for this assignment is to practice Python language (ex. class, method,
Object-Oriented Programming concepts, and syntaxes) and implement _simple_ and _binary search_ for
looking up the phone number of a given name.

## ðŸ“’[Week 2][W2]: Linked List & Selection Sort

The purpose of this assignment is to gain knowledge on the data structures: **Linked List** and **Selection Sort**. A
shopping list will be implemented for this exercise. The program stores shopping items in both
simple arrays or linked list. Each storing mechanism is separated into different files, such as
**`simple_array_shopping_list_manager.py`** or **`linked_list_shopping_list_manager.py`**, where each
file contains FileNameClass classes with essential methods for data manipulation.

## ðŸ—¼[Week 3][W3]: Stack & Recursive Functions

This assignment is to gain knowledge on **Stack** and **Recursive** functions.
A shopping list using Stack will be implemented for this exercise.
The program stores shopping items in both simple array or linked list-based Stack.

Each storing mechanism is separated into different files, such as 
`simple_array_shopping_list_manager.py` or `linked_list_shopping_list_manager.py`, 
where each file contains `FileNameClass` classes with essential methods for data manipulation.

## ðŸ¤“[Week 4][W4]: Quicksort

This assignment is to gain knowledge on quicksort using a linked list. A shopping list will be reimplemented for this exercise. The program stores shopping items in both simple arrays and linked lists utilizing different methods for either. Each storing mechanism is separated into different files, such as `simple_array_shopping_list_manager.py` or `linked_list_shopping_list_manager.py`, where each file contains FileNameClass classes with essential methods for data manipulation.

## ðŸ§®[Week 5][W5]: Hash Tables using Simple Array

This assignment is to gain knowledge on hash tables using a simple array along with a linked list. A grocery store inventory manager will be implemented for this exercise. The program stores inventory items in hash tables. Each storing mechanism is separated into different files, such as [simple_array_grocery_store_inventory.py][simp] or [`hash_grocery_store_inventory.py`][hash], where each file contains FileNameClass classes with essential methods for data manipulation. Note that [grocery_store_inventory.py][gsi] with the `main` method has already been provided. As part of the assignment, compare the actual runtime of hash tables operation between two inventory structures and justify in a short paragraph how it performs. Keep in mind to always comment on and document your class and methods.
