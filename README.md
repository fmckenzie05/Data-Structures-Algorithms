# CS469_Algorithms

Repository of Algorithms based on the weekly assignments

## ðŸ“”[Week 1][W1]: Python Fundamentals

This task for this assignment is to practice Python language (ex. class, method,
Object-Oriented Programming concepts, and syntaxes) and implement _simple_ and _binary search_ for
looking up the phone number of a given name.

## ðŸ“’[Week 2][W2]: Linked List & Selection Sort

The purpose of this assignment is to gain knowledge on the data structures: **Linked List** and **Selection Sort**. A
shopping list will be implemented for this exercise. The program stores shopping items in both
simple arrays or linked list. Each storing mechanism is separated into different files, such as
**`simple_array_shopping_list_manager.py`** or **`linked_list_shopping_list_manager.py`**, where each
file contains FileNameClass classes with essential methods for data manipulation.

## ðŸ—¼[Week 3][W3]: Stack & Recursive Functions

This assignment is to gain knowledge on **Stack** and **Recursive** functions.
A shopping list using Stack will be implemented for this exercise.
The program stores shopping items in both simple array or linked list-based Stack.

Each storing mechanism is separated into different files, such as 
`simple_array_shopping_list_manager.py` or `linked_list_shopping_list_manager.py`, 
where each file contains `FileNameClass` classes with essential methods for data manipulation.

## ðŸ¤“[Week 4][W4]: Quicksort

This assignment is to gain knowledge on quicksort using a linked list. A shopping list will be reimplemented for this exercise. The program stores shopping items in both simple arrays and linked lists utilizing different methods for either. Each storing mechanism is separated into different files, such as `simple_array_shopping_list_manager.py` or `linked_list_shopping_list_manager.py`, where each file contains FileNameClass classes with essential methods for data manipulation.

## ðŸ§®[Week 5][W5]: Hash Tables using Simple Array

This assignment is to gain knowledge on hash tables using a simple array along with a linked list. A grocery store inventory manager will be implemented for this exercise. The program stores inventory items in hash tables. Each storing mechanism is separated into different files, such as [simple_array_grocery_store_inventory.py][simp] or [`hash_grocery_store_inventory.py`][hash], where each file contains FileNameClass classes with essential methods for data manipulation. Note that [grocery_store_inventory.py][gsi] with the `main` method has already been provided. As part of the assignment, compare the actual runtime of hash tables operation between two inventory structures and justify in a short paragraph how it performs. Keep in mind to always comment on and document your class and methods.

## [Week 6][W6]: 

### Description

This assignment is to gain knowledge on the Breadth-first search using a queue. Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water. Note that `island_counter_main.py` with the `main` method and starter file `island_counter.py` with class has already been provided.

Comment and document your class and methods.

### `island_counter.py`

This class contains such methods as:

1. `init`
2. `print_grid_visited`
3. `count_island`
4. `mark_visited_island`

Please keep in mind the following notes for each method during implementation:

- `init()`: this method has already been provided.
- `print_grid_visited()`: this method has already been provided.
- `count_island()`: this method returns the number of islands while marking already visited grounds.
- `mark_visited_island(x,y)`: this method marks the current location as visited first.

After marking the current position, the method looks top/bottom/left/right first to see if it is a valid land and has never been visited using a queue. If the island has never been visited, the method marks the location as visited, and the function runs until the queue does not contain any coordinates.

1. ***Parameters***: x, y coordinate of the current location

### Outcome

```py
"""island_counter.py

This module contains a class, IslandCounterClass, which is responsible for
counting the number of islands in a 2D grid. Each cell in the grid is either
land ('1') or water ('0'). An island is defined as a group of '1's (land)
connected vertically or horizontally. The grid can be of any size.

The IslandCounterClass has the following methods:
- print_grid_visited: Prints the input grid and the cells that have been visited
                                                         during the island count.
- count_island: Counts the number of islands in the grid. It marks cells as
                                    visited when they are part of an island.
- mark_visited_island: Marks all cells of an island as visited. It uses a
                                      Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach.

### Using A Recursive Function

#### Question

Describe how this problem can be solved using a recursive function instead of a queue.

The problem of counting islands in a 2D grid can also be solved using a recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) approach instead of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach using a queue. The key difference is that DFS will explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, which makes it suitable for this problem where we need to explore all adjacent land cells ('1's) for each starting cell.

Here's an outline of how the mark_visited_island method might be modified to use DFS:

```py
def mark_visited_island(self, x: int, y: int) -> None:
    """
    Marks all cells of an island as visited using a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach.

    Args:
        x (int): The x-coordinate of the starting cell.
        y (int): The y-coordinate of the starting cell.
    """

    if not self.is_valid_land(x, y):
        return

    self.visit(x, y)

    # Recursively call mark_visited_island on neighboring cells
    self.mark_visited_island(x - 1, y)
    self.mark_visited_island(x + 1, y)
    self.mark_visited_island(x, y - 1)
    self.mark_visited_island(x, y + 1)
```

In this recursive approach, the mark_visited_island method first checks if the current cell is a valid part of an island using the is_valid_land method. If it is, it marks the cell as visited using the visit method, and then recursively calls mark_visited_island on the neighboring cells. This continues until all connected land cells have been visited, at which point the recursion ends and the method returns.

The main advantage of the recursive DFS approach over the BFS approach is its simplicity. The recursive method is more straightforward to implement and understand because it doesn't require managing a queue. However, DFS can consume more stack space than BFS if the maximum depth is large. This could potentially lead to a stack overflow for very large grids or very complex island shapes.
