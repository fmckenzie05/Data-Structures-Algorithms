# CS469_Algorithms

Repository of Algorithms based off the weekly assignments

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover:[Week 1][W1]

This task for this assignment is to practice python language (ex. class, method,
Object-Oriented Programming concept, and syntaxes) and implement simple and binary search for
looking up the phone number of a given name.

## ðŸ“’[Week 2][W2]

This purpose of this assignment is to gain knowledge on Linked List and Selection Sort. A
shopping list will be implemented for this exercise. The program stores shopping items in both
simple array or linked list. Each storing mechanism is separated into different files, such as
"simple_array_shopping_list_manager.py" or "linked_list_shopping_list_manager.py," where each
file contains FileNameClass classes with essential methods for data manipulation.
