## Results

These are the returned results from running `shopping_list.py`

```bash
------ Simple array ------
current list:    ['fish', 'mushroom', 'beef', 'pork', 'carrot', 'cheese', 'butter', 'bread', 'milk', 'banana', 'apple']
delete milk:     ['fish', 'mushroom', 'beef', 'pork', 'carrot', 'cheese', 'butter', 'bread', 'banana', 'apple']
last element:   apple

The results of running shopping_list.py show the comparison between the simple array implementation and the linked list implementation of a shopping list manager.

### simple array implementation

1. Insert operation took approximately 2.75e-05 seconds.
1. Delete operation took approximately 4.4e-06 seconds.
1. Lookup operation took approximately 2.3e-06 seconds.

### linked list implementation

1. Insert operation took approximately 1.46e-05 seconds.
1. Delete operation took approximately 6.9e-06 seconds.
1. Lookup operation took approximately 3.6e-06 seconds.

## Observations

- The insert operation is slightly faster in the linked list implementation compared to the simple array implementation.
- The delete operation is faster in the simple array implementation compared to the linked list implementation. This is because the linked list implementation has to traverse the list until it finds the item to delete, whereas the simple array implementation can directly access the item.
- The lookup operation is faster in the simple array implementation compared to the linked list implementation, as the array allows for direct access to the elements, while the linked list needs to traverse the list to find the desired item.

It is important to note that these results are specific to this particular case and may not be generalizable to all use cases. \
The performance of each implementation depends on various factors such as the size of the list, the distribution of the data, and the frequency of different operations.

## Smallest implementation

The smallest element in the shopping list are determined & sorted alphabetically. In this case, "apple" comes before all the other items in the list alphabetically, so it is considered the smallest element.

Comparing "apple" with "beef" or "pork", 'a' comes before 'b' and 'p', making "apple" the smallest element in the list. This has nothing to do with the length of the words themselves.

Note: The selection sort for the linked list is not implemented in this solution as it is not efficient for linked lists.
Comparing the runtime of insert/delete/lookup operations between the simple array and the linked list:

Insert operation:

Simple array: In the worst case, the insert operation takes O(n) time due to the need to shift elements when inserting at the front.
Linked list: The insert operation is constant time O(1) as it only requires updating pointers.
Delete operation:

Simple array: The delete operation takes O(n) time in the worst case, as the need to find the item's index and shift the elements after the deleted item.
Linked list: The delete operation takes O(n) time in the worst case, as the need to traverse the list and update the pointers.
Lookup operation (last element):

Simple array: The lookup operation is constant time O(1) as it directly accesses the last element using its index.
Linked list: The lookup operation takes O(n) time in the worst case, as the need to traverse the list to find the last element.
In conclusion, the linked list is more efficient for insert operations, while the simple array is more efficient for the lookup operation (for the last element). The delete operation has the same complexity for both data structures. However, the actual runtime can be different due to factors such as the underlying memory allocation and the size of the data. The selection sort is not recommended for the linked list because it requires a lot of pointer manipulation, and there are more efficient sorting algorithms for linked lists, such as merge sort.

In conclusion, the choice between a simple array and a linked list for managing a shopping list depends on the specific use case and the operations that will be performed most frequently. If insertions and deletions are more common, a linked list may be more efficient. However, if direct access to elements is a priority, a simple array may be a better choice.
